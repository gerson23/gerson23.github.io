I am a Computer Engineer with a Bachelor's degree from UNICAMP. I've been working professionaly with Python development and Automation Testing for about 5 years.

Python has been my preffered language since college, but recently I was also involved in Full Stack Development using Python, Node and Angular. So I can say that JS has ascended to my second language. Now I have this itch bugging me for a while to start learning about Rust... stay tuned.
