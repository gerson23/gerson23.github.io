I am a Computer Engineer with a Bachelor's degree from UNICAMP. I've been working professionaly for about 10 years going through a wide range of tech stacks and challenges.

Most recently I've been involved in a new project to provide our customers a trust-worthy platform to store their data and, at the same time, be able to generate analytics and insights from this data. From the many good challenges, I'd list some:

* Develop the Python infrastructure in Databricks to process generically data and provide the foundation for Data Scientists to develop new analytics
* Create APIs in FastAPI (Python) and .NET Core as well
* Implement IaC in Bicep templates (Azure Cloud)

In the past I've worked APIs (.NET Framework and Kotlin) and Python for automation, so it's been an awesome experience being able to put this knowledge together on top of a new Data Engineering paradigm and pure Azure Cloud.
